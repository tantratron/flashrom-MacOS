MacOS version able to offer GUI of flashrom.org application

Initial version worked with 1.2 flashrom so would not cover all chip memories, it worked under MacOS 10.14 and above MacOS.

An update to 1.4 was done by the creator but worked only under MacOS 12.4 (see https://github.com/MacThings/g-flash/issues/1)

Corrections in the Xcode project have been made so 1.4 can work again with MacOS 10.14 and compiled with Xcode 11.3.1
